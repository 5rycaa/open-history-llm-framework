# Part 4: Supplementary files for JDH publication

## Description
Here are the HTML files supporting our publication data. All HTML files are zipped in the single folder, hence to get the entire functionality of all the questions, one should download the folder, unzip them and open each HTML file individually. Some of the folders correspond to single questions, while some correspond to a longer dialog. Here is the overview of questions (as represented in the paper) and their corresponding folders:
